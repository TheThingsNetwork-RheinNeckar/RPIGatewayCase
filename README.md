# RPIGatewayCase
Case for RPI-ic880a Gateways for laser cutters 

We have built two experimental LoRaWAN gateways based on the iC880A concentrator board and controlled by a Rapsberry PI 3. Detailed description about cabling and software installation can be found [here](https://github.com/ttn-zh/ic880a-gateway/wiki TTN Zurich tutorial).

However we chose not to use a ready made case but design laser cut case.

## BOM

* Sheet of 3mm acrylic glass
* 24 M3X12 screws and corresponding nuts (to assemble the case)
* 4 M2.5 distance bolts (approx. 8mm female/male) with corresponding screws and nuts (to mount Raspberry PI)
* 4 M3 distance bolts (approx. 8mm female/male) with corresponding screws and nuts (to mount iC880A concentrator board)
* 3 suction cups with M4X11 screw and corresponding nuts

* Raspberry PI 3
* IC880a LoRaWAN concentrator board
* Antenna pigtail
* Antenne

## Features

* Uses suction cups to mount the gateway to a windows
* Offers access to USB power connection and network port
* Using tranparent or white acrylic glas 

## Shortcomings

* The case is not water proof and cannot be used outdoors
* The case is designed for jumper wire cabling and will not fit one of the available connector pcbs
